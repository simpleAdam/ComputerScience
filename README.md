* Google web Fundamentals
 According to Google, the core foundatiosn of a 'delightful web experience' are;
 * > Fast - It responds quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
 * > Integrated - The user doesn’t have to reach through the browser, it uses the full capabilities of the device to create an experience true to the device.
 * > Reliable - Load instantly and reliably, never showing the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
 * > Engaging - Keeps the user coming back to the app with beautifully designed experiences that look and feel natural.

* Responsive Web Design principles
  * > The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute   units like pixels or points
  * > Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.
  * > Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on.

Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. 
A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, 
which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.

### CGI
Perl is the de facto standard for CGI programming for a number of reasons, but perhaps the most important are:

* Socket Support-create programs that interface seamlessly with Internet protocols. Your CGI program can send a Web page in response to a transaction and send a series of e-mail messages to inform interested people that the transaction happened.
* Pattern Matching-ideal for handling form data and searching text.
* Flexible Text Handling-no details to worry. The way that Perl handles strings, in terms of memory allocation and deallocation, fades into the background as you program. You simply can ignore the details of concatenating, copying, and creating new strings.

The advantage of an interpreted language in CGI applications is its simplicity in development, debugging, and revision. By removing the compilation step, you and I can move more quickly from task to task, without the frustration that can sometimes arise from debugging compiled programs. Of course, not any interpreted language will do. Perl has the distinct advantage of having an extremely rich and capable functionality.

### Stack Machines
In computer science, computer engineering and programming language implementations, a stack machine is a type of computer. In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine.

The main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a pushdown stack of numbers rather than numbers held in processor registers. Because the operands used in the instructions are always in a known location, the top of the stack, the instructions themselves do not require memory addresses or register numbers to supply their operands. This leads to an instruction set architecture (ISA) style known as a zero address format.

Stacks are not unique to stack machines, most programming languages make extensive use of stacks to support subroutines and method calls. For this reason, stack machines more closely mimic the inner workings of the programs that run on them, assuming the programs are written in high level languages. This has led to a number of central processor unit designs that implement stack machines in order to provide higher performance. In practice, however, these designs have been outperformed by the traditional register machine systems, and have remained a niche player in the market.
