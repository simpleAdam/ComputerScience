* Google web Fundamentals
 According to Google, the core foundations of a 'delightful web experience' are;
  * > Fast - It responds quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
  * > Integrated - The user doesn’t have to reach through the browser, it uses the full capabilities of the device to create an experience true to the device.
  * > Reliable - Load instantly and reliably, never showing the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
  * > Engaging - Keeps the user coming back to the app with beautifully designed experiences that look and feel natural.

* Responsive Web Design principles
  * > The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute   units like pixels or points
  * > Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.
  * > Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on.

Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. 
A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, 
which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.

## Control Structures
### Flow of Control:
Flow of control through any given function is implemented with three basic types of control structures:
Sequential: default mode. Sequential execution of code statements (one line after another) -- like following a recipe
#### Selection: used for decisions, branching -- choosing between 2 or more alternative paths. In C++, these are the types of # selection statements:
* if
* if/else
* switch
#### Repetition: used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row. In C++, there are three types of loops:
* while
* do/while
* for

The function construct, itself, forms another way to affect flow of control through a whole program. 

## virtual machines
### Stack Machines
In computer science, computer engineering and programming language implementations, a stack machine is a type of computer. In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine.

The main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a pushdown stack of numbers rather than numbers held in processor registers. Because the operands used in the instructions are always in a known location, the top of the stack, the instructions themselves do not require memory addresses or register numbers to supply their operands. This leads to an instruction set architecture (ISA) style known as a zero address format.

Stacks are not unique to stack machines, most programming languages make extensive use of stacks to support subroutines and method calls. For this reason, stack machines more closely mimic the inner workings of the programs that run on them, assuming the programs are written in high level languages. This has led to a number of central processor unit designs that implement stack machines in order to provide higher performance. In practice, however, these designs have been outperformed by the traditional register machine systems, and have remained a niche player in the market.

## context-free grammar
The ECMAScript spec defines four grammars:

The lexical grammar describes how Unicode code points are translated into a sequence of input elements (tokens, line terminators, comments, white space).

The syntactic grammar defines how syntactically correct programs are composed of tokens.

The RegExp grammar describes how Unicode code points are translated into regular expressions.

The numeric string grammar describes how Strings are translated into numeric values.

Each grammar is defined as a context-free grammar, consisting of a set of productions.

The grammars use slightly different notation: the syntactic grammar uses LeftHandSideSymbol : whereas the lexical grammar and the RegExp grammar use LeftHandSideSymbol :: and the numeric string grammar uses LeftHandSideSymbol :::.

## dynamic programming
Memoization is at the heart of dynamic programming
The numeric string grammar describes how Strings are translated into numeric values.
